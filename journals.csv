The campaigns of two South Korean victim groups, the comfort women and camptown women, are examined to demonstrate that the process in which they must battle to obtain state redress through apology implies the existence of a discursive, gender-normative regime of victimhood. In this context, this article suggests that although the delivery of an apology for sexual violence might provide some form of gendered justice, this process may produce additional effects which work to discipline the related identities of gender and victimhood, and which have forced the comfort women and camptown women to compete for recognition by the South Korean state. The results of this struggle are ambivalent when it comes to victim agency and, in the cases examined in this article, the politics of apology has resulted in a somewhat impoverished form of redress for sexual violence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",political apology; rape myths; Sexual violence; South Korea; victimhood,NA,"Barkan, E., Karn, A., Group Apology as an Ethical Imperative (2006) Taking Wrongs Seriously: Apologies and Reconciliation, pp. 3-32. , Barkan E., Karn A., (eds), Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, and,. edited by; Bentley, T., (2016) Empires of Remorse: Narrative, Postcolonialism and Apologies for Colonial Atrocities, , London: Routledge; Brewer, J.D., (2010) Peace Processes: A Sociological Approach, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Brooks, R.L., The Age of Apology (1999) When Sorry Isn’t Enough: The Controversy Over Apologies and Reparations for Human Injustice, pp. 3-12. , Brooks R.L., (ed), New York and London: New York University Press,. edited by; Brownmiller, S., (1975) Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape, , New York: Bantam Books; Bumiller, K., (2008) In an Abusive State: How Neo-Liberalism Appropriated the Feminist Movement Against Sexual Violence, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Buss, D.E., Rethinking ‘Rape as a Weapon of War’ (2009) Feminist Legal Studies, 17, pp. 145-163. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10691-009-9118-5; Cheng, S., Popularising Purity: Gender, Sexuality and Nationalism in HIV/AIDS Prevention for South Korean Youths (2005) Asia Pacific Viewpoint, 46 (1), pp. 7-20; Cho, G.M., Diaspora of Camptown: The Forgotten War’s Monstrous Family (2006) Women’s Studies Quarterly, 34 (1-2), pp. 309-331; Choe, S., (2009) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/world/asia/08korea.html, Ex-Prostitutes Say South Korea and U.S. Enabled Sex Trade Near Bases.

Recent scholarship has addressed the neglected structural dimension when examining the incidence and variation of post-conflict gender-based violence. In particular, continuum of violence and feminist political economy perspectives have offered accounts of gender-based violence during and after conflict. However, these approaches overlook how war and post-war economic processes interact over time and co-constitute the material basis for the continuation of gender-based violence. The war and post-war political economy perspective that we leverage examines critically the distinction, both in theory and practice, between global and local dynamics, and between formal and informal actors in post-conflict societies. Exposing these neglected structural and historical interconnections with evidence from post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina, we demonstrate that the material basis of gender-based violence is a cumulative result of political and socio-economic dynamics along the war-to-peace trajectory. Our findings point to the need to be attentive to the enduring material consequences of interests and incentives formed through war, and to the impact of post-war global governance ideologies that transform local conditions conducive to gender-based violence. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The intersections of transnational capital, gender, and race in the production of sexual violence and internal displacement in Colombia’s armed conflict",2020,International Feminist Journal of Politics,1,"Department of Political Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria","Sachseder, J., (she/her/hers), Department of Political Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria","Investigating the nexus of transnational capital, gender, and race, I argue that sexual violence and internal displacement tacitly serve the interest of transnational corporations (TNCs). Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in war-torn regions in Colombia, I elucidate how violence is deeply intertwined in the globalization of neoliberal capitalism and operates by exploiting and instrumentalizing constructions of gender and race that are articulated through colonial legacies and further dehumanize the “Other.” The focus on intersectional power relations advances a critical understanding of the political economy of armed conflict. First, it reveals how local and global (economic) actors are entrenched in exacerbating local forms of domination that produce sexual violence and internal displacement through a particular political economy of masculinity and neoliberal forms of expansion and exploitation. Beyond that, both forms of violence are not only the product of colonial, capitalist, and gendered structures and ideas but also serve to re-entrench these power relations between dominant and subaltern groups. I conceptualize this relationship as the “coloniality of violence.” It constitutes a shared space for violent forms of domination and appropriation that facilitates capital accumulation, and it may further foster a relation of structural oppression in “post-conflict” Colombia. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This article reviews the literature on gender dimensions of DDR processes, exploring its many different topics–such as discussions of the definition of combatants, the political economy of DDR processes, group identity, cultural contexts, and masculinity–while focusing the discussion on the representation of female and male combatants of armed groups along the victim–actor axis. It furthermore analyzes the consequences of these representations for the way in which DDR processes are structured, and for who is allowed to participate in them. Finally, the article questions the push toward normalization in DDR processes and the neglect of progressive changes in gender relations within armed groups during war. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",actors; Demobilization; gender; normalization; reintegration; victims,NA,"Alison, M., Cogs in the Wheel?

Scant scholarly attention has been paid to women as prosecutors, despite the pivotal role that prosecutors play in determining who is charged and what charges they face. In this article, we explore the influence of women in the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) in international criminal courts. First, we examine the relationship between the presence of women on prosecutorial teams and sexual violence charges that are brought forth at trial. Next, we move beyond the influence of women prosecutors on indictments to consider how their presence is shaped by the internal dynamics of the institutions. We point to the culture of trial teams, the processes of investigations, and internal hierarchies to demonstrate how informal practices and gendered norms affect women’s positionality within the OTPs and their ability to provide gender justice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gender jurisprudence; international criminal courts; Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV),NA,"Acker, J., From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions (1992) Contemporary Sociology, 21 (5), pp. 565-569; Ambos, K., Bock, S., Procedural Regimes (2012) International Prosecutors, pp. 488-541. , Reydams L., Wouters J., Ryngaert C., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press, and,. edited by; Askin, K.D., Prosecuting Wartime Rape and Other Gender-Related Crimes Under International Law: Extraordinary Advances, Enduring Obstacles (2003) Berkeley Journal of International Law, 21 (2), pp. 288-349; Askin, K.D., A Decade of the Development of Gender Crimes in International Courts and Tribunals: 1993 to 2003 (2004) Human Rights Brief, 11 (3), pp. 16-19; Beckmann, M., Hall, R.L., Elite Interviews (2013) Interview Research in Political Science, pp. 196-208. , Mosley L., (ed), Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, and,. edited by; Bedont, B., Hall-Martinez, K., Ending Impunity for Gender Crimes Under the International Criminal Court (1999) Brown Journal of World Affairs, 6 (1), pp. 65-85; Bensouda, F., (2016), https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/160716_Pros_int_courts_and_the_fight_against_SGBC.pdf, The Prosecution of Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes by International Courts.

To study immigrant women employed in feminized work, this article uses the concept of gender as a social construction that informs, conveys, and adjusts power relations to explain how and why immigrant women occupy gendered jobs and to assess persisting inequalities and the unexpected benefits of gendered work. To illustrate this, we examine immigrant women in Los Angeles working in an ethnic niche: Brazilian samba dance. Our qualitative research on this case offers the opportunity to analyze the complexity of labor force dynamics. We discuss how the interaction of gender, nationality, race, and body aesthetic shapes our understanding of how immigrant women carve out economic niches, negotiate stigmas, and resignify gender relations through work. We conclude that work grants immigrant women power over (re)productive choices and the resistance needed to (re)define practices by challenging and conforming to social gender and work norms. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Female labor force participation; gender; immigrant workers; intersectionality; power relations,NA,"(2017), https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_S0201%26prodType=table, American FactFinder: Selected Population Profile the United States: Brazilians.

This paper examines this institutional change by approaching GAC as a highly differentiated workplace and work force in which developing a common institutional mandate and culture remains a challenge. We center an issue with particular resonance for how GAC experts and officers see themselves in relation to each other, to the merged department, and to their work–namely, their work attire. Associated constructions of gender, professionalism, and institutional affiliation linked to and expressed through work clothing shape perceptions of difference and power in the amalgamated department. Examining these constructions and how they both persist and change amid institutional shifts contributes to building both feminist analyses of diplomacy and development as embodied practices, and a labor geography of the state, with work clothing as a key everyday materiality linking the sites and scales of the individual body to the broader spatial and social organization of the department, especially to stereotypes and ideals of gender, professionalism, and institutional affiliation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Canada; clothing; development; diplomacy; embodiment; gender,NA,"Aggestam, K., Towns, A., The Gender Turn in Diplomacy: A New Research Agenda (2019) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 21 (1), pp. 9-28; Barry, B., (Re)Fashioning Masculinity: Social Identity and Context in Men’s Hybrid Masculinities through Dress (2018) Gender and Society, 32 (5), pp. 638-662; Bricker, D., Ibbitson, J., (2013) The Big Shift: The Seismic Change in Canadian Politics, Business, and Culture and What It Means for Our Future, , Toronto: HarperCollins; Brown, S., (2012) Struggling for Effectiveness: CIDA and Canadian Foreign Aid, , Montreal and Kingston, ON: McGill-Queen’s University Press, (ed; Brown, S., Heyer, M.D., Black, D.R., (2016) Rethinking Canadian Aid, , 2nd ed, Ottawa, ON: University of Ottawa Press, and, eds; Cardon, P.W., Okoro, E.A., Professional Characteristics Communicated by Formal Versus Casual Workplace Attire (2009) Business Communication Quarterly, 72 (3), pp. 355-360; Cassidy, J.A., Althari, S., Introduction: Analysing the Dynamics of Modern Diplomacy through a Gender Lens (2017) Gender and Diplomacy, pp. 1-11. , Cassidy J.A., (ed), New York: Routledge, and,. edited by; Cooper, A.F., The Changing Nature of Diplomacy (2013) The Oxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy, pp. 35-53. , Cooper A.F., Heine J., Thakur R., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press,. edited by; Cornut, J., To Be a Diplomat Abroad: Diplomatic Practice at Embassies (2015) Cooperation and Conflict, 50 (3), pp. 385-401; Cornut, J., Diplomacy, Agency, and the Logic of Improvisation and Virtuosity in Practice (2018) European Journal of International Relations, 24 (3), pp. 712-736; Cummins, E.R., Blum, L.M., ‘Suits to Self-Sufficiency’: Dress for Success and Neoliberal Maternalism (2015) Gender and Society, 29 (5), pp. 623-646; Dittmer, J., (2017) Diplomatic Material: Affect, Assemblage, and Foreign Policy, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Dittmer, J., McConnell, F., Introduction: Conceptualising Diplomatic Cultures (2016) Diplomatic Cultures and International Politics: Translations, Spaces and Alternatives, pp. 1-20. , Dittmer J., McConnell F., (eds), London: Routledge, and,. edited by; Dixon, D.P., (2015) Feminist Geopolitics: Material States, , Farnham: Ashgate; Dixon, D.P., Marston, S.A., (2013) Feminist Geopolitics: At the Sharp End, , New York: Routledge, and, eds; Dowler, L., Sharp, J., A Feminist Geopolitics?

The committee commented: “This article provides a solid and nuanced account of UN mediation processes around the WPS agenda, drawing on Annick Wibben’s narrative approach to document how the notion that mediation is a science rather than an art leaves little room for complexity. It is a very well-researched piece with a clear, polished, and coherent argument.” “The article’s meticulous engagement with a bureaucratic procedure reminds the reader of its life-and-death consequences, all the while providing a sophisticated and solid gender analysis. It is also important for revealing the complexities–how masculine–feminine assumptions and expectations work, or that one method is not necessarily better than another for gender inclusiveness. The author’s conclusion is a generative one: it recognizes the need to explore the question in other settings and points to a future research agenda.” ABSTRACT The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda has not yet had a large or lasting impact on United Nations (UN)-brokered peace processes. I argue that we can understand the challenges to incorporating the WPS agenda by examining the changes that UN mediation has undergone in the post-Cold War era. UN mediation has moved from being seen as a diplomatic art to being seen as a professionalized science. Narratives about mediation as an “art” or as a “science” have distinct implications for how the UN has incorporated the WPS agenda in mediation. To examine these narratives, I adopt Wibben’s feminist narrative approach. I analyze texts including UN guidance documents on mediation, notes from participant observation of training sessions on mediation and gender, and 37 interviews with UN mediation personnel. I find that the narrative of mediation as a science constructs a linear process with little room for complexity. In doing so, it depoliticizes gender relations and constrains the participation of women. The narrative of mediation as an art privileges experience, consent, and trusting relationships. Including women and gender issues appears risky because it endangers consent. Meanwhile, building trust may rely upon excluding certain groups of people. These findings contribute to our understanding of how institutional contexts affect the implementation of the WPS agenda. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Gender; mediation; narratives; UN; WPS agenda,NA,"Adkins, L., Lury, C., The Labour of Identity: Performing Identities, Performing Economies (1999) Economy and Society, 28 (4), pp. 598-614; Aggestam, K., Svensson, I., Where Are the Women in Peace Mediation?

Yet, women have engaged in various activities to exercise collective and individual agency to impact political participation. This article examines how Tamil women’s political participation in post-war Sri Lanka exists along a continuum, from formal participation within state structures and party politics to informal community participation. Scholarship about Tamil women’s political participation is framed within discourses of “militants,” “ex-combatants,” “political mothers,” or “victims.” Using narrative interviews, we argue that–based on their awareness of unequal gendered power relations, structures, and norms impacting their lives in post-war Sri Lanka–Tamil women in Mannar exercise agency to challenge these constraints and promote a broader transformative political arena. Some women attempt to expand the agency of others and to promote a collective voice through which women can be better represented in politics. Drawing on feminist international relations and gender and development knowledge, this study demonstrates how political agency is constituted within informal arenas, disrupting masculinist assumptions about who is considered a political actor and what counts as political agency by examining the spectrum of political participation in post-war contexts. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gender; Political participation; post-war; Sri Lanka; Tamil women,NA,"Alison, M., (2009) Women and Political Violence: Female Combatants in Ethno-National Conflict, , London: Routledge; Alsop, R., Bertelsen, M.F., Holland, J., (2006) Empowerment in Practice: From Analysis to Implementation, , Washington, DC: World Bank Publications; Arnstein, S.R., A Ladder of Citizen Participation (1969) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35 (4), pp. 216-224; Azmi, F., I Want My Wings Back to Fly in a New Sky: Stories of Female Ex-LTTE Combatants in Post-War Sri Lanka (2015) Female Combatants in Conflict and Peace, pp. 200-215. , Shekhawat S., (ed), London: Palgrave Macmillan,. edited by; Azmi, F., Brun, C., Lund, R., Young People’s Recovery in Eastern Sri Lanka: From War to Postwar and Beyond (2017) Conflict, Violence and Peace, pp. 169-186. , Harker C., Hörschelmann K., Skelton T., (eds), Singapore: Springer, and,. edited by; Bandarage, A., Women, Armed Conflict, and Peacemaking in Sri Lanka: Toward a Political Economy Perspective (2010) Asian Politics & Policy, 2 (4), pp. 653-667; Batliwala, S., The Meaning of Women’s Empowerment: New Concepts from Action (1994) Population Policies Reconsidered: Health, Empowerment, and Rights, pp. 127-138. , Sen G., Germain A., Chen L.C., (eds), Cambridge, MA: Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies,. edited by; Berry, M.E., Barriers to Women’s Progress after Atrocity: Evidence from Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina (2017) Gender & Society, 31 (6), pp. 830-853; Berry, M.E., Rana, T.R., What Prevents Peace?

The country has formulated and strictly enforced a series of policies to address climate change directly. This article argues for the importance of studying China’s climate change policies from a gender perspective, particularly given the speed and import of action. It does so in three steps. First, it examines gendered differences in perceptions of climate change and in the impacts of climate change policies. Second, it examines the environment-related content in China’s gender policies and the gender-related content in its climate change policies. Through the comparison between these two, we argue that it is easier to include climate change in gender policies in China than to include gender in climate change policies and that the integration of these two is anything but robust. Third, we analyze the multiple and varied roles played by women in climate change policy making, as well as women’s conspicuous absence from some key high-level political conversations. The article concludes that gender awareness in Chinese climate change policy needs to be supplemented by gender sensitivity and we suggest some measures to move toward this goal. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; climate change; environment; Gender; gender sensitivity,NA,"Aguilar, L., Granat, M., Owren, C., (2015) Roots for the Future: The Landscape and Way Forward on Gender and Climate Change, , Washington, DC: IUCN & GGCA; Arora-Jonsson, S., Virtue and Vulnerability: Discourses on Women, Gender and Climate Change (2011) Global Environmental Change, 21 (2), pp. 744-751; Buckingham, S., Le Masson, V., (2017) Understanding Climate Change through Gender Relations, , New York: Routledge; Buckley, C., (2017) New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/world/asia/chinas-role-in-climate-change-and-possibly-in-fighting-it.html, China’s Role Climate Change, and Possibly Fighting It.

It first reviews the existing literature and then provides an analysis based on in-depth interviews with women members of peace networks in Thailand and in Myanmar and key stakeholders with relevant knowledge. The findings highlight the challenges that women's networks face in both countries: (1) the challenge of getting a seat at the table in the peace processes where women are increasingly visible in peace-building activism yet still lack power to influence formal frameworks; (2) the challenge of getting representation and the support of various local communities; and finally, (3) the challenge of getting the message right in terms of balancing gender advocacy with peace building in a context where gender advocacy is perceived as disrupting social relations. These key findings suggest that, to be effective, women's peace networks have to find the right balance between gender advocacy and addressing these key challenges. The article ends with a set of recommendations aimed at strengthening the impact of women's peace networks. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gender; Myanmar; Peace process; Thailand; women’s participation,NA,"(2016) News Corp Australia Network, , https://www.news.com.au/world/asia/bomb-blast-rocks-night-market-in-pattani-thailand/news-story/d98317a47e440708c9c9e88c769eabce, Bomb Blast Rocks Night Market Pattani, Thailand.

23,Kunz R.,25224592500;,Messy feminist knowledge politics: a double reading of post-conflict gender mainstreaming in Liberia,2020,International Feminist Journal of Politics,NA,"Institut d’Etudes Politiques (IEP), Université de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Kunz, R., Institut d’Etudes Politiques (IEP), Université de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","The debate around the production and circulation of feminist knowledge has been rekindled since the emergence of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. While much attention focuses on the diffusion of WPS norms, less is paid to the sociocultural context within which feminist ideas circulate through WPS gender-mainstreaming (GM) interventions, its broader implications, and what happens beyond. I propose a double reading of GM as a site of feminist knowledge production and circulation: I combine anthropological and feminist governmentality insights to analyze GM as a form of (disciplinary) governing with insights from post/decolonial scholars that call for an engagement with the “exteriority” of interventions, with what lies outside our grid of intelligibility of the narrow political terrain of GM. Through a case study of the post-conflict GM intervention in Liberia, I illustrate how this double reading reveals the ways in which GM works as a gendered form of governing to prescribe dualistic social roles and (re)produce social differentiation mechanisms linked to “civilization.” An engagement with the exteriority of the GM intervention reveals critiques and alternative forms of feminist knowledge production and circulation that emphasize non-dualistic and non-judgmental attitudes and propose invited partnership and dialogue. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Feminist knowledge circulation; gender mainstreaming; governmentality; norm diffusion; post-conflict Liberia; post/decolonial feminism; Women, Peace and Security",NA,"Adichie, C.N., (2009) The Danger of a Single Story, , https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story?language=en, TED Talks; Aharoni, S.B., Internal Variation in Norm Localization: Implementing Security Council Resolution 1325 in Israel (2014) Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State & Society, 21 (1), pp. 1-25; Ahmed, S., (2004) The Cultural Politics of Emotion, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Ahmed, S., The Language of Diversity (2007) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 30 (2), pp. 235-256; Aisha, F., Mainstreaming Gender in Peace Support Operations: The United Nations Mission in Liberia (2005) A Tortuous Road to Peace: The Dynamics of Regional, UN and International Humanitarian Interventions in Liberia, pp. 147-163. , http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/TORTUOUSCHAP7.PDF, Aboagye F., Bah A., (eds), Pretoria: Institute for Security Studies,. edited by; Alaga, E., Security Sector Reform and the Women’s Peace Activism Nexus in Liberia (2011) Women and Security Governance in Africa, pp. 68-88. , Olonisakin F., Okech A., (eds), Cape Town: Fahamu/Pambazuka,. edited by; Bacon, L., (2012) Innovations for Successful Societies, , http://www.princeton.edu/successfulsocieties/content/data/policy_note/PN_id191/Policy_Note_ID191.pdf, Building an Inclusive, Responsive National Police Service: Gender-Sensitive Reform Liberia, 2005–2011; Basini, H., Gender Mainstreaming Unraveled: The Case of DDRR in Liberia (2013) International Interactions, 39 (4), pp. 535-557; Basini, H., Ryan, C., National Action Plans as an Obstacle to Meaningful Local Ownership of UNSCR 1325 in Liberia and Sierra Leone (2016) International Political Science Review, 37 (3), pp. 390-403; Brown, D., On the Category ‘Civilised’ in Liberia and Elsewhere (1982) Journal of Modern African Studies, 20 (2), pp. 287-303; Christoffersen, K., (2010), https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/12973, Disarming and Reintegrating Female Ex-Combatants: A Case Study of the Gender Mainstreaming of DDR Liberia; Cohn, C., Kinsella, H., Gibbings, S., Women, Peace and Security Resolution 1325 (2004) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 6 (1), pp. 130-140; Diop, B., (2012) Women Making Peace: The Triple M Factor: Bineta Diop at TEDxMartigny, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKBLKoD6KAU; Drumond, P., (2015) Promoting Democracy in Preventing Electoral Violence: The Womens Situation Room, , http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/sites/genre/shared/Genre_docs/Actus/SDSN_Final_Brief.pdf, ’s Situation Room.

24,Wilén N.,55151357900;,Achieving a gendered transformation of the post-conflict military through security sector reform: unpacking the private–public dynamics,2020,International Feminist Journal of Politics,NA,"Political Science Department, Université Librede Bruxelles (ULB), Bruxelles, Belgium; Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations, Brussels, Belgium; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), Oslo, Norway","Wilén, N., Political Science Department, Université Librede Bruxelles (ULB), Bruxelles, Belgium, Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations, Brussels, Belgium, Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), Oslo, Norway","Reforms of the post-conflict military are often part of a broader security sector reform (SSR), focusing on public state institutions in the security domain. The military, as a traditionally masculine institution, has been targeted for reforms related to gender integration and mainstreaming in order to make it more democratic and representative. Yet, while these efforts have partly succeeded in making gender issues essential to the military, I argue here that in order to achieve a gendered transformation of the military and erase the gender hierarchy, it is necessary to move focus beyond the public sphere and into the private to examine how these are mutually dependent. I illustrate this point through examples taken from interviews with soldiers from national armies in two countries that have experienced wide-ranging reforms following conflict: Burundi and South Africa. I identify three societal borders policing women in the private sphere, which have an impact in the public sphere: resistance to women in the army, women as primary caregivers, and men’s perceived superiority over women. The examples show how a gendered transformation needs to collapse borders between public and private in order to make visible gendered forms of exclusion and discrimination in the military. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Gender; military; private/public distinction; security sector reform (SSR); women,NA,"Abrahamsen, R., Exporting Decentred Security Governance: The Tensions of Security Sector Reform (2016) Global Crime, 17 (3-4), pp. 281-295; Adelman, M., The Military, Militarism, and the Militarization of Domestic Violence (2003) Violence Against Women, 9 (9), pp. 1118-1152; Åhäll, L., On the Imagination of ‘Woman’ as Killer in War (2016) Handbook on Gender and War, , Sharoni S., Welland J., Steiner L., Pedersen J., (eds), Cheltenham: Edward Elgar,. edited by, 47–65; Andersen, L.R., (2011) Security Sector Reform and the Dilemmas of Liberal Peacebuilding, , DIIS Working Paper, 31; Axelsson, S., Gendered Struggle for Freedom: A Narrative Inquiry into Female Ex-Combatants in South Africa (2015) Female Combatants in Conflict and Peace, pp. 167-184. , Shekhawat S., (ed), London and New York: Palgrave Macmillan,. edited by; Baker, B., The Future is Non-State (2010) The Future of Security Sector Reform, pp. 208-228. , Sedra M., (ed), Waterloo: CIGI,. edited by; Bastick, M., (2015) Gender and Complaints Mechanisms: A Handbook for Armed Forces and Ombuds Instiutions, , Geneva: DCAF; Bastick, M., Valasek, K., (2009) Gender and Security Sector Reform Training Resource Package, , Geneva: DCAF, and, eds; Bosco, J., (2015), Le Major Flora de l’armée burundaise, une main de fer dans un gant de velours.

25,Edenborg E.,57196059398;,Russia’s spectacle of “traditional values”: rethinking the politics of visibility,2020,International Feminist Journal of Politics,1,"Global Politics and Security Programme, Swedish Institute of International Affairs, Stockholm, Sweden","Edenborg, E., Global Politics and Security Programme, Swedish Institute of International Affairs, Stockholm, Sweden","This article examines the role of visibility in efforts to define “the people” in specifically gendered and sexualized ways. In doing this, it contributes to queer and feminist international relations (IR) scholarship, where visibility and invisibility, although central themes, are sometimes insufficiently problematized. In a case study of Russia’s contemporary project of “traditional values,” I show how the Kremlin-promoted heteropatriarchal definition of community relates to efforts to control the visibility of gendered and sexualized bodies, and how those regulations are resisted, with respect to queer visibility, on the one hand, and patriotic military visibility, on the other. I argue: (1) that efforts by states to define and delineate “the people,” involve the production of arrangements of visibility, regulating what gendered, sexualized, and racialized bodies can appear in public, and how they are seen; and (2) that those who resist hegemonic conceptions of community seek to disturb and reorder those arrangements of visibility, by making visible bodies that have been rendered invisible or making already present bodies visible in new ways. However, such forms of embodied appearance will not necessarily come in the form of antithetical opposition, but may be more ambivalent. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",LGBT; militarization; Russia; traditional values; Visibility,NA,"Agadjanian, A., Tradition, Morality and Community: Elaborating Orthodox Identity in Putin’s Russia (2017) Religion, State and Society, 45 (1), pp. 39-60; Åhäll, L., The Dance of Militarisation: A Feminist Security Studies Take on ‘the Political’ (2016) Critical Studies on Security, 4 (2), pp. 154-168. , https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2016.1153933; Alexievich, S., (2013) Tsinkovye mal’chiki, , Moscow: Vrem’a; Altman, D., Symons, J., (2016) Queer Wars: The New Global Polarization Over Gay Rights, , Cambridge: Polity; Amar, P., (2013) The Security Archipelago: Human-Security States, Sexuality Politics, and the End of Neoliberalism, , Durham: Duke University Press, NC; Arendt, H., (1958) The Human Condition, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Åse, C., Wendt, M., (2019) Gendering Military Sacrifice: A Feminist Comparative Analysis, , Abingdon: Routledge; Ayoub, P., (2016) When States Come Out: Europe’s Sexual Minorities and the Politics of Visibility, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Baer, B.J., Now You See It: Gay (In)Visibility and the Performance of Post-Soviet Identity (2013) Queer Visibility in Post-Socialist Cultures, , Fejes N., Balogh A.P., (eds), Chicago, IL: Intellect,. edited by, 35–56; Baker, C., The ‘Gay Olympics’?

This article analyzes experiences of the Lakota Sioux in order to provide new insights into the conceptualization of security in IR, particularly around the notion of ontological security. It does so by unpacking various aspects of Lakota cosmology and then ethnographically exploring Lakota lived-experiences of (in)security. Lakota understandings offer glimpses into new constellations of being, premised on relations, purpose, balance and unity. This work represents multi-year interpretivist research on a Lakota reservation in the Great Plains, United States, and finds that Lakota cosmology provides significant insight to how traditions, culture and spirituality establishes a sense of security. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cosmology; decolonization; Lakota Sioux; ontological security; Security,NA,"Ackerly, B., Stern, M., True, J., (2006) Feminist Methodologies for International Relations, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Ackerly, B., True, J., Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations (2008) International Studies Review, 10, pp. 693-707; Alfred, G.A., (2009) Peace, Power, Righteousness: An Indigenous Manifesto, , Toronto: Oxford University Press; Aradau, C., Security and the Democratic Scene: Desecuritization and Emancipation (2004) Journal of International Relations and Development, 7, pp. 388-413; Baaz, M.E., Stern, M., Why do Soldiers Rape?

Such measurements rest on unrealistic assumptions about gender relations within the household; thus, their use in development projects risks masking gender disparities and rendering invisible serious intra-household food access inequalities. To demonstrate the problems resulting from these presumed gender-neutral measurements, this paper examines a set of metrics that influence food security policy and reveals gender biases in their methodological design and use. The paper concludes by offering simple methodological guidelines for mainstreaming gender analysis in household food security measurement processes and calls for a deeper analysis based on a feminist application of the capabilities approach. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",capabilities; food security; Gender; household; measurements,NA,"(2010) Food Security and Livelihood Assessments: A Practical Guide for Field Workers, , https://www.actioncontrelafaim.org/en/publication/food-security-and-livelihood-assessments-a-practical-guide-for-field-workers/, London: ACF International; Agarwal, B., ‘Bargaining’ and Gender Relations: Within and Beyond the Household (1997) Feminist Economics, 3 (1), pp. 1-51; Ah Poe, C., (2005) Integrating a Gender Perspective into Vulnerability Analysis, , Rome: WFP; Alinovi, L., Mane, E., Romano, D., (2009) Measuring Household Resilience to Food Insecurity: Application to Palestinian Households, , Rome: EC-FAO Food Security Programme; Alkire, S., Foster, J., Counting and Multidimensional Poverty Measurement (2011) Journal of Public Economics, 95 (7-8), pp. 476-487; Anderson, C.L., Reynolds, T., Biscaye, P., Greenaway, M., Merfeld, J., Polygamous Households and Intrahousehold Decision-Making: Evidence and Policy Implications from Mali and Tanzania (2016) The 2016 APPAM International Conference “Inequalities: Addressing the Growing Challenge for Policymakers Worldwide,”, , 0–36; Aubel, J., The Role and Influence of Grandmothers on Child Nutrition: Culturally Designated Advisors and Caregivers (2012) Maternal & Child Nutrition, 8 (1), pp. 19-35; Avallone, S., Estelle Tiemtore, T.-W., Mouquet-Rivier, C., Trèche, S., Nutritional Value of Six Multi-Ingredient Sauces from Burkina Faso (2008) Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 21 (7), pp. 553-558; Becker, G.S., (1976) The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Bilinsky, P., Swindale, A., (2010) Months of Adequate Household Food Provisioning (MAHFP) for Measurement of Household Food Access: Indicator Guide (v.4), , Washington, DC: USAID.

31,Coburn E.,6505871536;,Trickle-down gender at the International Monetary Fund: the contradictions of “femina economica” in global capitalist governance,2019,International Feminist Journal of Politics,1,"International Studies, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada","Coburn, E., International Studies, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada","What forms do gender equity arguments take in major international institutions? What broader struggles do these reflect? What contradictions does gender mainstreaming reproduce and what feminist possibilities does it open up? This contribution describes, critiques, and tentatively explains the recent understudied “gender turn” in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Fund, a major international financial institution. The IMF's concern with gender is late compared to other multilateral institutions, like the United Nations and the World Bank. Nonetheless, since 2013, the IMF has published more than 2,900 documents, videos, and podcasts specifically about women, alerting the public to gender equity matters through a dedicated “Gender and IMF” homepage and through Twitter, via the hashtags #Women4Growth and #IMFGender. In so doing, the IMF draws on existing, economistic “women's empowerment” initiatives by major finance and corporate enterprises, in newly opened policy space following the 2008–09 crisis, under unprecedented feminist leadership at the highest level of the Fund. The IMF's attentiveness to gender, pursued alongside market-led economic efficiency aims, produces a new actor, “femina economica.” This elastic figure is symptomatic of tensions within the organization and of broader contradictions in the current, uncertain moment of the capitalist world political economy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Economics; femina economica; gender mainstreaming; International Monetary Fund; political economy,NA,"Amin, S., Fifty Years Is Enough!

However, these theories are unable to explain patriarchy’s profound influence on bureaucrats or to propose strategies to reduce bureaucratic resistance. This study suggests that Putnam’s social capital theory allows us to see that, in the political process of gender mainstreaming, feminist activists need social relations to strengthen their mobilizing solidarity, potential allies, legitimacy, and power. We examined how and why the Taiwanese feminist activists who participated in women’s policy machineries from 2005 to 2009 successfully institutionalized gender mainstreaming throughout the central government, including the installation of individual gender equality committees in all ministries. We found that their success lay in their ability to utilize political opportunities, emotion work, and confrontational tactics to enhance their social capital. They also created and established important social capital with and among politicians and civil servants. Their experience shows that gender equality mechanisms that allow civil society groups to engage in decision-making processes and that provide regular opportunities for dialogue between feminists and state actors can improve gender mainstreaming implementation and reduce bureaucratic resistance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",central government; emotion work; femocrat; gender equality machinery; Social capital; women’s movements in Taiwan,NA,"Almond, G., Verba, S., (1989) The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Banaszak, L.A., (2010) The Women’s Movement Inside and Outside the State, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Benschop, Y., Verloo, M., Sisyphus’ Sisters: Can Gender Mainstreaming Escape the Genderedness of Organizations?

Ukraine's case demonstrates that in a situation of active conflict, the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda becomes strongly linked to military security. Drawing on interviews, documents, and narratives by feminist and public figures, I argue that the WPS agenda in Ukraine has taken a narrow militarized form as a result of a combination of three interrelated and mutually constitutive factors: the ongoing conflict, nationalistic feminism, and the role of international organizations. The open conflict has generated a militaristic and nationalistic discourse among mainstream Ukrainians with an emphasis on defending the country. This discourse has been translated by international organizations and national actors into the WPS agenda, which has prioritized security sector reforms. Implementation of the WPS agenda in Ukraine therefore seems to be at odds with this norm's feminist principles. It is not leading to peace but to militarization, neglecting broader insecurities, including socioeconomic inequalities that have, in turn, been exacerbated by the conflict and the state's institutional reforms. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Conflict; international organizations; nationalism; Peace and Security; Ukraine; UNSCR 1325; Women,NA,"Basini, H., Ryan, C., National Action Plans as an Obstacle to Meaningful Local Ownership of UNSCR 1325 in Liberia and Sierra Leone (2016) International Political Science Review, 37 (3), pp. 390-403; Bergeron, S., Cohn, C., Duncanson, C., Rebuilding Bridges: Toward a Feminist Research Agenda for Postwar Reconstruction (2017) Politics and Gender, 13 (4), pp. 715-721; (2016) National Action Plan on Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution #1325 “Women.

However, the literature has not fully considered that green parties may provide unique insight into women's representation due to their longstanding ideological attachment to feminism. To understand the question of women's representation in green parties, this analysis examines green parties in 20 European countries. Relying on data from party websites and quotaproject.org, the following categories were examined: the inclusion of women in leadership positions, the inclusion of enforced gender quotas in party structure, the inclusion of women's party member organizations, the structure of recruitment processes, and the content of party platforms. The results show that European green parties maintain a higher level of commitment to gender equality than their individual parliaments. This piece contributes to the growing literature on green parties by examining the ideological connection between green parties and feminism, as well as studying a larger cross-section of green parties than previous studies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",European parties; feminist politics; Green parties; women’s representation,NA,"Burchell, J., Evolving or Conforming?

Drawing on gender audits of two international agricultural research institutions, we discuss the performativity of three types of technologies: material technologies intended to increase agricultural productivity, such as new seed varieties; social technologies, such as household surveys and evaluation techniques used to monitor projects; and political technologies, such as participation, deployed to enlist farmers in the adoption of productivity-enhancing material technologies. We show that all three technologies participate in performing gender as they are introduced into rural environments, sometimes in interaction with an “apparatus of gender” that emerges from gender mainstreaming. But performances are not uniform, producing both an iron cage of hierarchical gender dualism, but also enactments that exceed the vision of the apparatus, blur binaries and diffract the realities they project in unanticipated directions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Agricultural technology; gender and development; science and technology studies (STS),NA,"Adekunle, A., Fatunbi, A.O., Buruchara, R., Nyamwaro, S., Integrated Agricultural Research for Development: From Concept to Practice (2013) Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), Accra, Ghana, , http://ciat-library.ciat.cgiar.org/articulos_ciat/biblioteca/integrated_agricultural_research_for_development_from_concept_to_practice.pdf, Accessed August 10, 2017., and,.

An important part of this debate concerns silence, particularly how certain individuals are silenced and how this might be challenged through images. This article looks at the ways images can be used to make gender-specific security problems visible. It holds that text, images and practices interact to construct (in)security and outlines a tripartite text-image-practice model for analyzing these interactions. Through a case study of the British women’s suffrage movement it illustrates the potential of the text-image-practice model. The suffrage movement leveraged visuals, militancy and practices like hunger-striking to resist attempted silencing by the government across textual, verbal and visual planes. Using this case, it shows how posters were used to try to silence Suffragettes and how Suffragettes resisted silencing. Thus, it demonstrates that images are important sites of feminist resistance and security politics that can communicate a politics of the body. The article also offers an illustration of how historical cases of gender insecurity and resistance as well as their visualization can be brought into Feminist Security Studies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",critical security studies; Feminism; silencing; Suffragettes; visual politics,NA,"Åhäll, L., Gender (2018) Visual Global Politics, , Bleiker R., (ed), New York: Routledge,. edited by, 150–156; Alison, M., Women as Agents of Political Violence: Gendering Security (2004) Security Dialogue, 35 (4), pp. 447-463; Andersen, R.S., Vuori, J.A., Guillaume, X., Chromatology of Security: Introducing Colours to Visual Security Studies (2015) Security Dialogue, 46 (5), pp. 1-18; Aradau, C., Hill, A., The Politics of Drawing: Children, Evidence, and the Darfur Conflict (2013) International Political Sociology, 7 (4), pp. 368-387; Ashworth, L., Feminism, War and the Prospects for Peace (2011) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 13 (1), pp. 25-43; Bargu, B., The Silent Exception: Hunger Striking and Lip-Sewing (2017) Law, Culture and the Humanities, pp. 1-28. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1743872117709684, May; Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music, Text, , New York: Hill and Wang,.

Scholars and activists have highlighted the negative effects of these trends for rural populations. International institutions have promoted the recognition of land rights as a means to secure land from seizure, ensure equal participation in land acquisitions, and enable low-income populations, including women, to access credit. At the same time, activists are promoting collective land rights, customary modes of land tenure and the rights of Indigenous peoples. For activists, land reform models that promote the collective rights of peoples to govern land are critical to resisting individualized land ownership models that encourage the alienation of land. This article reviews these rights-based frameworks using a critical feminist perspective and argues that both the institutionalist and activist approaches require more nuanced understandings of gender and difference in order to effect gender-equitable change. This article concludes by mapping new feminist research directions that consider land and resources within the context of local–global processes, the global economy, intersectionality and global rights-based discourses. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",collective rights; food sovereignty; gender; international institutions; Land governance,NA,"Agarwal, B., (1994) A Field of One's Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia, , New York: University of Cambridge Press; Agarwal, B., (2003) Journal of Agrarian Change, , http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0366.00054/abstract, Gender and Land Rights Revisited: Exploring New Prospects Via the State, Family and Market. 3 (1‐2): 184–224; Agarwal, B., Food Sovereignty, Food Security and Democratic Choice: Critical Contradictions, Difficult Conciliations (2014) The Journal of Peasant Studies, 6 (41), pp. 1-22; Alden Wily, L., ‘The Law is to Blame’: The Vulnerable Status of Common Property Rights in Sub-Saharan Africa (2011) Development and Change, 42 (3), pp. 733-757; Arora-Jonsson, S., Forty Years of Gender Research and Environmental Policy: Where do we Stand?

It argues that collaging and queering share many points of departure: in both, objects are taken from their conventional contexts and assembled into new relational constellations. The article draws from pedagogical work where collages were used in university teaching on the politics of gender and sexuality. A set of collages made by students are interpreted and brought into a dialogue with queer theorizing. The article suggests that collaging involves smashing a variety of containers that social sciences inquiry often operates with. It troubles not only established conceptions of sexuality and intimacy but also territoriality and theorizing. On this basis, the article concludes that collaging offers a fruitful modality of thought, analysis and expression for queer world-making projects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",art; Collages; IR methodology; pedagogy; queer; relationality,NA,"Agnew, J., The Territorial Trap: The Geographical Assumptions of International Relations Theory (1994) Review of International Political Economy, 1 (1), pp. 53-80; Åhäll, L., Affect as Methodology: Feminism and the Politics of Emotion (2018) International Political Sociology, pp. 1-17. , https://doi.org/10.1093/ips/olx024; Ahmed, S., (2010) The Promise of Happiness, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Ahmed, S., (2017) Living a Feminist Life, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Andrucki, M.J., (2017), http://societyandspace.org/2017/10/31/queering-social-reproduction-or-how-queers-save-the-city/, Queering Social Reproduction: How Gay Men Save the City.

The authors contribute to these studies through an in-depth analysis of female combatants’ struggles for equality and empowerment during and after Nepal’s decade-long Maoist conflict. Scholars have argued that the emphasis of Maoist ideology in Nepal on the emancipation of women and on ending gender discrimination attracted a large number of women to the cause. Based on narratives of Maoist female ex-combatants, the authors investigate women’s engagement with Maoist ideology during and after the conflict. These narratives reveal that despite discourses of gender equality in Nepal’s Maoist struggle, promises around gender equality remain unkept in the period after the war. A reintegration program has offered women ex-combatants few options and has pushed women back into traditional gender roles. Struggles continue in this terrain. Incorporating intersectionality, the paper highlights how women ex-combatants’ gender identities intersect with caste and other social locations to produce diverse challenges for their lives. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The author argues that norms about sexuality and the intended audience of violence motivate male sexual violence in three ways. First, perpetrators choose to express power over the individual victim through the weaponization of masculinity, bodily integrity and/or sexual identity. Second, sexual violence can be used to reaffirm group belonging and hetero-masculinity among perpetrators. Third, sexual violence sends a message to a larger community or nation regarding supremacy and power hierarchies. Two examples (Abu Ghraib and Nazi concentration camps) are presented to illustrate the framework’s concepts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",homosexualization; Male sexual violence; military masculinity; military socialization; sexual violence,NA,"Ackerman, A.R., The Use of Masculinities in the Understanding and Treatment of Male Sexual Offenders (2015) Sex Crimes: Transnational Problems and Global Perspectives, pp. 44-63. , Ackerman A.R., Furman R., (eds), New York: Columbia University Press,. edited by; Auchter, J., Forced Male Circumcision: Gender-Based Violence in Kenya (2017) International Affairs, 93 (6), pp. 1339-1356; Athey, S., (2011) Torture: Power, Democracy, and the Human Body, , The Torture Device: Debate and Archetype. edited by Shampa Biswas and Zahi Zalloua, 129–157.

The colonial history of Spanish, British, American, and Japanese occupations has left the country politically fragmented and prone to armed violence. The major protracted conflicts relate to the Government’s fights with insurgency movements led by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), striving for self-determination of Muslim population inhabiting the Bangsamoro Region, and by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), struggling to establish a communist society. Conflict resolution appears on the horizon from time to time (the milestone Bangsamoro Organic Law was signed only last year, enforcing the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro from 2014), but peace is always fragile in the complex Philippine context, where the socio-political situation continues to evolve dynamically. Due to ongoing clashes in the southern parts of the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte declared Martial Law in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) on May 23, 2017. The Martial Law was recently prolonged for the third time, now to last until the end of 2019, having become the major security crisis in the country in decades. Furthermore, Duterte canceled peace talks with the CPP in November 2017. Despite attempts, the peace talks have not resumed to date. Instead, the security situation of the Philippines is increasingly tense and politicized. Similar to many other conflict-affected countries, in the Philippines women bear the consequences of armed conflicts perhaps most acutely. Professor Jasmin Nario-Galace has dedicated her life to peace education but she is not a typical scholar sitting behind the desk. Instead, she risks her safety traveling to conflict zones in the Philippines as well as internationally to teach peace and reconciliation strategies, focusing on the rights of. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,NA,NA,Int.

Existing studies have shown how international diffusion processes have contributed to the adoption of two kinds of such institutions – gender mainstreaming and gender quotas. Mounting evidence suggests that institutional reforms within legislatures constitute the latest wave of gendered institutional reform. This article identifies and explains trends in the adoption of one kind of gender-focused parliamentary institution – women’s legislative caucuses (WLCs). We use a discrete time duration model to assess the effect of several factors on WLC establishment. While there is theoretical room to expect diffusion, structural and institutional variables to affect the likelihood of caucus adoption, we find the strongest empirical support for diffusion and institutional factors. A parliament’s likelihood of adopting a WLC rises when sub-regional peers have created WLCs, when women’s international non-governmental organizations are active in the country and when the country has implemented a gender quota. Understanding the factors that affect the adoption of gender-focused parliamentary institutions is critically important, we argue, since such bodies provide space to confront masculinized institutionalized rules and norms. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Caucus; Diffusion; Feminist institutionalism; Gender; Gender-focused parliamentary institutions; Gendered institutions; Legislatures; Parliaments; Representation; Women,NA,"Barnes, T., (2016) Gendering Legislative Behaviour: Institutional Constraints and Collaboration, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Beckwith, K., Numbers and Newness: The Descriptive and Substantive Representation of Women (2007) Canadian Journal of Political Science/Revue Canadienne De Science Politique, 40 (1), pp. 27-49; Berkovitch, N., The Emergence and Transformation of the International Women’s Movement (1999) Constructing World Culture: International Non-Governmental Organizations since 1875, pp. 100-126. , edited by J.

Although these global frameworks, and other international resolutions, underscore the importance of women’s participation in the politics of peace and security, Nigeria’s frameworks have not been inclusive. Extant literature has examined the role of women within the context of mainstream responsibilities for “counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency” that are held by the military and paramilitary forces. This study interrogates the role of women-led civil society organizations in “countering violent extremism” activities in Nigeria. Using a mixed-methods approach, it demonstrates that the participation of women-led civil society organizations in “countering violent extremism” activities has generated certain positive results for achieving women’s inclusion and gender equality in politics and society. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Civil society organizations; Counter-insurgency; Counter-terrorism; Countering violent extremism; Feminism; Gender equality; International security; Women,NA,"Abdullahi, Y.R., (2017) Survival in the Margins: Almajiri and Waste Management in Northern Nigerian Urban Centres, , In Dealing with Waste: Resource Recovery and Entrepreneurship in Informal Sector Solid Waste Management in African Cities edited by O.

54,Choi N.,22833595900;,Women’s political pathways in southeast asia,2019,International Feminist Journal of Politics,2,"Leiden University Institute for Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands","Choi, N., Leiden University Institute for Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands","While Southeast Asian women’s socioeconomic status and formal political rights have improved significantly in recent decades, women remain under-represented in the region’s political institutions, especially at local levels of governance. Although interest in Southeast Asian women’s political representation has increased in recent years, our understanding of women’s experiences in their pursuit of elected office remains limited. Through a critical reading of the literature on women and politics and an examination of experiences in Southeast Asia, this article highlights gaps between normative theories and elite-biased empirical studies of women’s political advancement and the conditions, processes and outcomes observed across several Southeast Asian countries. Drawing on original ethnographic research in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, this article identifies three major pathways by which women in Southeast Asia have sought election and re-election to political office. In so doing, the article highlights the significance of understanding women’s varied experiences and suggests an agenda for further research. © 2018 The Author(s).

Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; Idan, O., Department of Education and IDC-Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Herzliya, Israel","This article demonstrates how the gendered patriarchal mechanisms that exclude women from the political sphere are being produced, re-produced, and challenged in interpersonal political conversations by concentrating on the discursive mechanisms that construct the way young Israeli women and men talk about politics. The research is based on a yearlong intra-group dialog process. The group met for weekly sessions during two semesters, in which the group members discussed and expressed their thoughts and feelings regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) demonstrated how the political space is being marked, defined and delimited through gendered discursive practices. We present the different roles participants take in the group, and in particular the different strategies women use in face of disciplinary discursive mechanisms. The process revealed that the development in the group discussion was strongly intertwined with the change in the positioning strategies of the female participants. In particular, we found that women deployed emotionality as a tool of resistance that challenges gender binaries and masculine dominance. Our conclusion highlights the importance of the daily interactions in creating, sustaining and changing the political discourse of a society in conflict. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Discourse analysis; Gender; Politics; Power mechanisms; Sociolinguistics,NA,"Aharoni, S.B., Internal Variation in Norm Localization: Implementing Security Council Resolution 1325 in Israel (2014) Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State & Society, 21 (1), pp. 1-25; Bandura, A., Moral Disengagement in the Perpetration of Inhumanities (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3 (3), pp. 193-209; Bar-Tal, D., (2013) Intractable Conflicts: Socio-Psychological Foundations and Dynamics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ben David, Y., Hameiri, B., Benheim, S., Leshem, B., Sarid, A., Sternberg, M., Nadler, A., Sagy, S., Exploring Ourselves Within Intergroup Conflict: The Role of Intragroup Dialogue in Promoting Acceptance of Collective Narratives and Willingness Toward Reconciliation (2017) Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 23 (3), p. 269; Berkovitch, N., Motherhood as a National Mission: The Construction of Womanhood in the Legal Discourse in Israel (1997) Women’s Studies International Forum, 20 (5-6), pp. 605-619; Brody, L.R., Gender Differences in Emotional Development: A Review of Theories and Research (1985) Journal of Personality, 53 (2), pp. 102-149; Butler, J., (1990) Gender Trouble.” Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, , New York and London: Routledge; Butler, J., Critically Queer (1993) GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 1 (1), pp. 17-32; Chetrit, S.S., (2009) Intra-Jewish Conflict in Israel: White Jews, Black Jews., , Abingdon: Routledge; Coates, J., (2015) Women, Men and Language: A Sociolinguistic Account of Gender Differences in Language, , New York: Routledge; Daphna-Tekoah, S., Harel-Shalev, A., “Living in a Movie” —Israeli Women Combatants in Conflict Zones (2014) Women’s Studies International Forum, 44, pp. 26-34; Eisler, R., From Domination to Partnership: The Hidden Subtext for Sustainable Change (1994) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 7 (4), pp. 32-46; Foucault, M., (1978) The History of Sexuality, I. , New York: Vintage; Francis, D., (2010) From Pacification to Peacebuilding: A Call to Global Transformation.

This article analyzes how gendered and sexualized subjectivities and symbols are mobilized in recent marketing campaigns launched by the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF). In these campaigns, Sweden is performed as a “progressive” nation/state whose citizens hold values, rights and freedoms considered “extreme in the eyes of others,” thus being in need of protection by the SAF. This notion of Swedish progressiveness— often constituted as equality between people of all sexual orientations and gender identities—is epitomized in the campaign slogan “Sweden, a country to fall in love with/in.” This article probes how performative enactments of a gender-exceptional nation works within broader discursive terrains constituting a military institution undergoing large-scale transformations. We argue that constructions of a tolerant and modern Sweden (re)produce treacherous, single narratives of distant and dangerous Others and risk making invisible domestic discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, ultimately enabling the ongoing rearmament and reterritorialization of the SAF. © 2018 The Author(s).

Although women’s support was central to the ability of Islamists to win power, after the uprising Islamists failed to grant women significant political rights and autonomy. While the existing literature on gender and nationalism demonstrates that practical gains for women are frequently sidelined by their movements in a post-revolutionary era, there is increasing recognition of the need to examine the relationship between feminism and nationalism in relation to the particular context in which this evolves. This article substantiates this claim with new evidence. Based on a feminist ethnographic study of the Muslim Sisterhood, the female members of the Egyptian MB movement, conducted in Cairo between 2013 and 2018, the article demonstrates that a new gender politics has emerged among Islamist women activists as a result of their engagement in revolutionary struggle. This gender politics has explicit feminist overtones, which have become evident as women begin to challenge men’s position of privilege within the sphere of the family. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",activism; Arab uprisings; Egypt; feminism; Islamist women; Muslim Brotherhood; subjectivity,NA,"Al-Ali, N., Reflections on (Counter) Revolutionary Processes in Egypt (2014) Feminist Review, 106 (1), pp. 122-128; Al-Ali, N., Pratt, N., Between Nationalism and Women’s Rights: The Kurdish Women’s Movement in Iraq (2011) Middle East Journal of Culture and Communication, 4, pp. 339-355; Al-Ali, N., Tas, L., Reconsidering Nationalism and Feminism: The Kurdish Political Movement in Turkey (2018) Nations and Nationalism, 24 (2), pp. 453-473; Allam, N., Activism amid Disappointment: Women’s Groups and the Politics of Hope in Egypt (2018) Middle East Law and Governance, 10 (3), pp. 291-316; Allam, N., (2018) Women and the Egyptian Revolution: Engagement and Activism during the 2011 Arab Uprisings, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Badran, M., Competing Agendas: Feminists, Islam and the State in 19th and 20th Century Egypt (1991) Women, Islam and the State, pp. 201-236. , Kandiyoti D., (ed), London: Macmillan,. edited by; Ben Shitrit, L., (2016) Righteous Transgressions: Women’s Activism on the Israeli and Palestinian Religious Right, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Biagini, E., The Egyptian Muslim Sisterhood between Violence, Activism and Leadership (2017) Mediterranean Politics, 22 (1), pp. 35-53; Enloe, C., (2014) Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics, , 3rd ed, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Fahmi, G., (2015), http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/07/14/struggle-for-leadership-of-egypt-s-muslim-brotherhood-pub-60678, The Struggle for the Leadership of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood.

It does so to broaden our understanding of gendered and peace agency in troubled and divided societies, in which complex and conflicting discourses meet. Analyzing data from interviews with feminist and women’s groups’ representatives, it examines how nationalism and women’s approaches to gender, politics, peace, and conflict enable or restrict feminist and women’s agency. It finds that a strategic essentialist approach has initiated a reconfiguration of gender(ed) power relations, women’s agency, and peacebuilding processes. It argues that when this approach is combined with feminist theory and praxis and the employment of transnational peace paradigms, the possibilities for feminist and women’s agency increase, as long as feminist scholarship and grassroots activism inform each other through dialogue. Therefore, it highlights the nuanced and complex dialectic between essentialist and anti-essentialist feminist gender discourses. Moreover, it challenges theories that posit a rigidly hierarchical relation between local and transnational gendered and peace agency paradigms, by demonstrating their malleability and reciprocity. Thus, it contributes to the debate about the modalities and possibilities of feminist sociopolitical intervention in nationalism- and conflict-ridden contexts. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cyprus; feminism; gender; nationalism and peace; women’s agency,NA,"Agathangelou, A.M., Envisioning a Feminist Global Society: Cypriot Women, Civil Society and Social Change (2003) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 5 (2), pp. 290-299; Agathangelou, A.M., Killian, K.D., Epistemologies of Peace: Poetics, Globalization, and the Social Justice Movement (2006) Globalizations, 3 (4), pp. 459-483; Agathangelou, A.M., Spira, T.L., Sacrifice, Abandonment, and Interventions for Sustainable Feminism(s): The Non-profit Industrial Complex and Transborder Substantive Democracy (2007) Sustainable Feminisms: Advances in Gender Research, Volume 11, pp. 75-93. , Sarker S., (ed), Oxford: Elsevier, and,. edited by; Agathangelou, A.M., Turcotte, H.M., ‘Feminist’ Theoretical Inquiries and ‘IR’ (2010) The International Studies Encyclopedia, Volume IV, pp. 2227-2254. , Denmark R., (ed), Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, and,. edited by; Alvarez, S.E., Advocating Feminism: The Latin American Feminist NGO ‘Boom’ (1999) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 1 (2), pp. 181-209; Alvarez, S.E., Translating the Global: Effects of Transnational Organizing on Local Feminist Discourses and Practices in Latin America (2000) Meridians, 1 (1), pp. 29-67; Anthias, F., Women and Nationalism in Cyprus (1989) Woman–Nation–State, pp. 150-167. , Yuval-Davis N., Anthias F., (eds), London: Macmillan,. edited by; Anthias, F., Yuval-Davis, N., Contextualizing Feminism: Gender, Ethnic and Class Divisions (1983) Feminist Review, 15 (1), pp. 62-75; Anthias, F., Yuval-Davis, N., Introduction (1989) Woman–Nation–State, pp. 1-15. , Yuval-Davis N., Anthias F., (eds), London: Macmillan, and,. edited by; Basu, A., Globalization of the Local/Localization of the Global: Mapping Transnational Women’s Movements (2000) Meridians, 1 (1), pp. 68-84; Basu, A., (2010) Women’s Movements in the Global Era: The Power of Local Feminisms, , Boulder, CO: Westview Press, ed; Beckwith, K., Mapping Strategic Engagements: Women’s Movements and the State (2007) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 9 (3), pp. 312-338; Black, N., (2005), Women Walk HomeBut How?

Some activists in favor of bringing analysis of masculinities into WPS policies propose that a focus on reshaping masculinities and femininities as a strategy for resisting militarism is necessary to return the agenda to what they perceive as its “original” purpose of preventing war. Drawing on my personal experiences as an NGO advocate, and on participant observation and interviews with UK government officials, this article explores what we can learn from efforts to integrate a “masculinities perspective” into WPS policies. I argue that, while some language concerning men and boys and, to a lesser degree, masculinity/ies has been incorporated into these policies, this is usually done in ways that subvert the intentions of civil society actors who have advocated for this shift. As a result, these concepts have been assimilated in ways that do not challenge militarism, and indeed at times serve to normalize it. I argue that this demonstrates the limitations of WPS policies as a vehicle for pursuing feminist anti-militarist goals. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

60,Uehling G.L.,6505887293;,Working through warfare in Ukraine: rethinking militarization in a Ukrainian theme café,2019,International Feminist Journal of Politics,NA,"Program on International and Comparative Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","Uehling, G.L., Program on International and Comparative Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","The conflict between Ukraine and Russia in the Donbas region has led both countries to strengthen their respective militaries. The literature on militarization emphasizes the subtle and largely unconscious ways in which militarization spreads through society. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2015 and 2017, I argue that attention to the intersubjective aspects of the process exposes the self-conscious working-through of military realities. I make this argument using the case study of a restaurant run by demobilized fighters, Café Patriot. Specifically, I show how the café's proprietors aimed to provide an anti-depressive atmosphere for fighters, and to provoke critical thinking among non-combatant patrons. The café challenged theorizing on militarization by effacing the separation between military and civilian as predicted, but doing so in the interest of reminding people of militarization rather than blinding them to it. These findings highlight veterans’ constructive efforts to re-inhabit a fractured world, and contrast with portrayals in critical studies of militarized masculinity. In sum, the café represented an effort to intervene in the process of militarization using, strangely enough, the trappings of militarization.

I consider various lip-sewing protests by refugees and the strategic use of speechlessness and corporeality in these protests to uncover the conditions in which contemporary refugees are imbricated. I argue that this unusual form of protest, as well as the demands that protesters make on states and international institutions through dissensus, reflects the existence of a new kind of refugee that has emerged in response to the contemporary refugee management system that criminalizes displacement. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",crisis; Europe; lip sewing; protests; Refugees,NA,"(2010), https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-19/sewing-lips-a-desperate-act-of-powerlessness/2344014, Sewing Lips a ‘Desperate Act’ of Powerlessness.

In addressing the research question, the paper focuses on changes in attitudes toward gender-specific roles and conduct, notions of acceptable behavior within male–female interaction, and perceptions of gender hierarchies. Male low-level combatants are defined in terms of a collective identity and the analysis utilizes the concept of relational comparisons of other identity groups as a tool through which to explore gendered meanings and perceptions of the “masculine self,” “the collective,” and the “gendered other.” Using empirical data from qualitative interviews with former members of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), relational comparisons are applied to three out-groups: (1) state forces, (2) female PLA members, and (3) the rural population. Contrary to other studies on men and insurgency, this research strives to move beyond a focus only on masculinity and violence, and places particular emphasis on how men engage with a more gender-equal ideology within the movement than exists in society. By presenting fresh insights into this area of study, the paper also discusses normally disregarded possibilities for former combatants as agents for change in post-conflict transformative agendas. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gender; gender; identity; insurgency; Masculinity; peace and conflict,NA,"Abdelal, R., Herrera, Y.M., Johnstone, A.I., McDermott, R., Identity as a Variable (2006) Perspectives on Politics, 4 (4), pp. 695-711; Ackerly, B.A., Stern, M., True, J., (2006) Feminist Methodologies for International Relations, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Adhikari, A., (2014) The Bullet and the Ballot Box: The Story of Nepal's Maoist Revolution, , New Delhi: Aleph Book Company; (2010), https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Nepal-Across-Lines-2010-English.pdf, Across the Lines Women and Sexual Violence the Nepali Conflict. 1–108.

68,Turner L.,56844613800;,Syrian refugee men as objects of humanitarian care,2019,International Feminist Journal of Politics,1,"Arnold Bergstraesser Institute, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany","Turner, L., Arnold Bergstraesser Institute, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany","Critical feminist scholars of conflict and displacement have demonstrated that “womenandchildren” (Enloe 1993) have become an uncontroversial object of humanitarian concern in these contexts (Carpenter 2003; Hyndman and Giles 2011). Yet very little scholarly work has attempted to understand the position of refugee men as a demographic within humanitarianism. Through an analysis of the Syria refugee response in Jordan, this article investigates how humanitarian workers relate to refugee men and think about refugee masculinities. It argues that refugee men have an uncertain position as objects of humanitarian care. Seeing refugee men as objects of humanitarian care would disrupt prevailing humanitarian understandings of refugeehood as a feminized subject position and of gender work as work that “helps women” (Cornwall 2007; Johnson 2011). It would furthermore challenge prevailing binary visions of refugee men as agential, political actors, and refugee women as in need of “empowerment” through the implementation of technocratic programming. In the context of the Syria refugee response, these gendered and racialized understandings of refugee men and masculinities are mediated by particular conceptions of “Arabness.” This research is based on ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative interviews with humanitarian workers and Syrian refugees, which was undertaken in Jordan in 2015–2016. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gender; Humanitarianism; masculinities; men; Syrian refugees,NA,"Abdelali-Martini, M., de Pryck, J.D., Does the Feminisation of Agricultural Labour Empower Women?

Focusing on the case of a midwife who sued a county for refusing to hire her after having learned she would not participate in abortions, the article analyzes how both anti- and pro-abortion groups frame the issue of conscientious objection as aligned with “Swedish exceptionalism” in terms of worker co-determination and adherence to international conventions. The article thus strengthens the feminist contention that the issue of abortion, regardless of how precisely it is framed, tends to mobilize nationalist discourses, but also highlights how anti-abortion movements can “think global, act local.”. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Although the demographics of these marriage migrants have transformed over the years, a misunderstanding still exists as migrant wives are seen as commodities and gaining citizen status is seen as their ultimate goal. Using in-depth interviews, this research takes a bottom-up approach by allowing Chinese migrant women in Taiwan to define and interpret their own citizenship. It explains how they negotiate the politics of citizenship as they confront harsher immigration restrictions than immigrants of other origins because of their Chinese identity. This paper suggests that immigrants’ intersectional identities shape their conceptualization of Taiwanese citizenship, although their agency is limited. My findings illustrate that some Chinese migrant wives embrace citizenship entitlements while others’ experiences with citizenship differ depending on their positionality in both the private and the public. My findings also show that some migrant wives actively reject Taiwanese citizenship, challenging the myth that all Chinese immigrants desire Taiwanese citizenship. This study contributes to citizenship and migration studies using a feminist, intersectional approach and raises implications for the degree to which migrant wives have agency in constructing their citizenship. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; citizenship; marriage intersectionality; Migration; Taiwan,NA,"Ackerly, B.A., Women's Human Rights Activists as Cross-Cultural Theorists (2001) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 3 (3), pp. 311-346; Baaz, M.E., Stern, M., (2013) Sexual Violence as a Weapon of War?

Using interview, document, and observational data, I situate this inquiry in the context of US women’s work in the Peace Corps, an organization within a field marked by colonialism. I find that White women and women of color have similar and yet instructively different experiences of their gendered identities in field sites, because race and gender differently affect their identities and relative privilege abroad. Specifically, White women volunteers are often afforded some degree of “male” privilege because of their race (though their race may render them vulnerable to sexual violence), while some volunteers of color are afforded a degree of “White” privilege because of their nationality (although their race may also render them vulnerable to violence). However, because the Peace Corps does not challenge conventional race and gender privileges, it lacks the organizational orientation and capacity to effectively address safety and assault among its women volunteers. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",development; gender; Intersectionality; Peace Corps; race; women,NA,"Acker, J., Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations (1990) Gender & Society, 4 (2), pp. 139-158; Acker, J., Revisiting Class: Thinking from Gender, Race, and Organizations (2000) Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State & Society, 7 (2), pp. 192-214; Adler, N.J., Women Do Not Want International Careers: And Other Myths About International Management (1984) Organizational Dynamics, 13 (2), pp. 66-79; Adler, N., Izraeli, D.N., Competitive Frontiers: Women Managing Across Borders (1994) Competitive Frontiers: Women Managers in a Global Economy, pp. 22-40. , Cambridge, MA: John Wiley & Sons, and, eds; Anthias, F., Yuval-Davis, N., Contextualizing Feminism: Gender, Ethnic and Class Divisions (1983) Feminist Review, 15 (1), pp. 62-75; Appadurai, A., Number in the Colonial Imagination (1993) Orientalism and the Post-Colonial Predicament: Perspectives on South Asia, pp. 314-341. , Breckenridge C.A., Van Der Veer P., (eds), Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press,. edited by; Baines, D., Gender Mainstreaming in a Development Project: Intersectionality in a Post-Colonial Un-Doing?

74,Rossone de Paula F.,57205705171;,Brazil’s non-indifference: a case for a feminist diplomatic agenda or geopolitics as usual?,2019,International Feminist Journal of Politics,NA,"Independent Researcher, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Rossone de Paula, F., Independent Researcher, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Brazil took advantage of its economically and politically privileged position to challenge global normative structures. In 2004, the concept of “non-indifference” was integrated into the Brazilian vocabulary of foreign policy, justifying and legitimating the country’s acceptance of the invitation to command the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). On the one hand, non-indifference can be read as a discursive maneuver that enabled Brazil to accommodate its non-interventionist agenda to an old geopolitical game, given the pressure imposed upon “global players” to respond effectively and assertively to threats to international peace and security. On the other hand, the “Brazilian way” could also be seen as an alternative to a highly masculinized geopolitical approach to international security. This paper explores possible limitations, tensions and/or opportunities that emerge from the encounter between a feminist diplomatic agenda and a masculinizing ordering of the international space. It does so by contrasting Brazil’s ambition for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the club of powerful states, with Brazil’s diplomatic and military performance during MINUSTAH, widely evaluated as a success due to characteristics such as solidarity, generosity, flexibility and the “warm conviviality” of Brazilian culture. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Brazilian diplomacy; feminist geopolitics; international security; MINUSTAH; non-indifference,NA,"Aggestam, K., Towns, A., The Gender Turn in Diplomacy: A New Research Agenda (2018) International Feminist Journal of Politics, pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2018.1483206, and; Almeida, P.W., Brazilian View of Responsibility to Protect: From ‘Non-Indifference’ to ‘Responsibility While Protecting’ (2014) Global Responsibility to Protect, 6 (1), pp. 29-63. , https://doi.org/10.1163/1875984X-00601003; Amorim, C., Política externa do governo Lula: os dois primeiros anos (2005) Análise de conjuntura - Observatorio Político Sul-Americano, 4, pp. 1-14; Amorim, C., (2010) The Statement by H.E.

It shows how ignorance of the gendered nature of diplomatic norms and practices impacts our understanding of diplomatic history, and how specific biographies are hampered by gender blindness in particular. Using the history of Margaret van Kleffens and Dutch World War II diplomacy as an example, the article demonstrates how historians’ continued neglect of the role of women and gender norms has influenced representations of twentieth-century diplomacy. To dismiss the history of gender and of women as by definition irrelevant to the actions of states and of male statespersons is not simply part of a self-appointed focus on the political at the expense of the personal; rather, it omits much of the political history too, reproducing stereotypes and resulting in a skewed understanding of diplomatic history and foreign policy decisions. The article argues that both historians and feminist scholars need to historicize gender in order to recognize women’s roles in diplomacy, and so gain a better understanding of the history of international politics as a whole. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Based on analysis of the core agenda-setting documents, it traces where two different versions of women’s economic empowerment, “liberal” (including women in the formal economy) and “liberating” (women collectively mobilizing to challenge the status quo), appear in the WPS agenda. It argues that the two exist in uneasy tension in the UN’s aspirations for women’s economic security post-war, but that when it comes to actual activities and achievements, the liberal version dominates over the liberating version. The article argues that it is important not to overstate the divide between the two approaches, and that the seeds of a liberating approach can be found within the liberal. It is initiatives to facilitate women’s economic empowerment that contain opportunities for collective action to transform the structures of the economy that WPS advocates should advocate. This would strengthen the WPS agenda and its ability to contribute to security as feminists envisage it, as encompassing freedom from want as well as freedom from fear. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",economic empowerment; peace; security; United Nations; Women,NA,"Abelenda, A.I., Abbas, H., (2017), https://www.awid.org/news-and-analysis/we-will-only-achieve-womens-economic-empowerment-if-corporate-power-curbed, We Will Only Achieve Women’s Economic Empowerment If Corporate Power Is Curbed.

By locating this study within an analysis of the expansion of global capital accumulation, the article argues that the liberal frameworks of female empowerment and entrepreneurialism that are central to these programs and to feminism in this form, mask their underlying political, social and economic objectives. In contrast, a Marxist Feminist approach more adequately explains the interplay of class and gender that underpins poverty alleviation strategies. This article argues that in the context of financial crisis and reduced social provision, women living in poverty in the Global South were identified as targets for the expansion of global finance. Their integration into global financial networks via microfinance and other pro-poor strategies has facilitated the expansion of markets for credit while at the same time disciplining market participation through the twin forces of risk and incentive. Disciplinary neo-liberal feminism has underpinned this incorporation of women into global capital accumulation creating profound effects for households and families, with microfinance programs representing important sites of contestation for the politics of class and gender. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Disciplinary neo-liberal feminism; incentive; microfinance; risk; social reproduction,NA,"(2011) Market Brief, , https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/The%20Middle%20of%20the%20Pyramid_The%20Middle%20of%20the%20Pyramid.pdf, The Middle of the Pyramid: Dynamics of the Middle Class Africa.

82,"Aggestam K., Towns A.",8760663300;6701843490;,The gender turn in diplomacy: a new research agenda,2019,International Feminist Journal of Politics,10,"Department of Political Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Department of Political Science, Gothenburg University, Göteborg, Sweden","Aggestam, K., Department of Political Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Towns, A., Department of Political Science, Gothenburg University, Göteborg, Sweden","This article argues that the (re-)constitution of diplomacy is intimately linked to gender and the practices of exclusion and inclusion of women and men over time. While the big debates in both academia and among practitioners concern the change and continuity of diplomacy in the last hundred years, gender has received scant, if any, attention. The overarching aim of this article is therefore to advance a new research agenda, which can spur future gender studies and contribute to rethinking diplomacy. It presents an original narrative about three distinct bodies of diplomatic scholarly work that focus on (1) diplomatic history; (2) descriptive representation; and (3) gendered institutions. We conclude that first there is a need to move out of Europe and North America to provide greater focus on Africa, Asia and Latin America. Second, there is a need to move beyond the descriptive single case studies towards more systematic comparisons, which can trace change in institutional gender dynamics over time. Ethnographic work can provide novel insights to gendered micro-processes and the daily mundane institutional practices. Third, as part of the gender turn in the field of diplomacy international feminist theory can generate significant theoretical contributions to the transformation of diplomacy. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

As communication technologies and neoliberal globalization alter forms of communication, the potential for organizing, coalitions, and advocacy work across time and space, such as through transnational feminist networks (TFNs), has grown. Understanding the rise of TFNs has largely relied on historical narratives and case studies, and the literature has tended to emphasize transnational over regional dimensions. Our approach, however, finds that regional connections not only play an important role in linking TFNs to local women’s rights initiatives in southern Africa, but that information-rich academic institutes focusing on gender studies bring structure to local and regional information networks in the region and act as bridges between the local, regional and global. Methodologically, we employ an innovative approach to visibly capture the work of regional and local activists by taking a meso-level snapshot of website links among 70 women’s rights organizations operating in southern Africa. We pair the network visualization with a case study of our central academic center, the African Gender Institute, to demonstrate the work of this critical hub in the local and regional communication network. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",African Gender Institute; communication network visualization; southern Africa; transnational feminist networks; Women’s rights,NA,"Abbas, H., (2014) Feminist Wire, , http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/feminists-love-amina-mama/, Feminists We Love: Professor Amina Mama.

The celebration of neoliberalism and normalization of militarism allow the private security industry to draw upon the labor of eager contractors and their supportive spouses. This article develops a feminist analysis of the role of the private security household in global security assemblages. In what ways are households connected to the outsourcing of security work to Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs), and how are these connections gendered? Through interviews with female spouses of former UK Special Air Services soldiers, now private security contractors, we demonstrate how the household is both silenced and yet indispensable to how PMSCs operate and how liberal states conduct war. These spouses supported the transition from military service to private security work, managed the household, and planned their careers or sacrificed them to accommodate their husband’s security work. Their gendered labor was conditioned by former military life but animated by neoliberal market logics. For the most part, the women we interviewed normalized the militarized values of their husband’s work and celebrated the freedom and financial rewards this type of security work brought. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Introducing original interview data from former British Reaper drone crews and focusing on their experiences of conducting lethal operations, this article builds on feminist and queer theorizing to illuminate the instability of the binary distinction between masculinity and femininity as traditionally understood. Developing “Haunting,” I draw out three themes: complex personhood, in/(hyper)visibility, and disturbed temporality as the frames through which the intersection of gender and drone warfare can be examined. I draw upon the conceptual metaphor of the ghost to explore the dead that is also alive, the absent that is also present, and that silence that is also a scream. Through this, I argue that Haunting provides a framework for both revealing and destabilizing gendered binaries and is therefore a useful tool for feminist security and international relations scholars. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Drones; gender; haunting; military technologies; queer logic(s),NA,"Ahmed, S., (2006) Queer Phenomenology, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Acheson, R., Moyles, R., Nash, T., (2014) Sex and Drone Strikes: Gender and Identity in Targeting and Casualty Analysis, , http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/resources/publications-and-research/publications/9367-sex-and-drone-strikes-gender-and-identity-in-targeting-and-casualty-analysis, Reaching Critical Will of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom and Article 36.

On the one hand, migrants are produced as people to be pitied, rescued, and saved. On the other hand, they are feared, despised, and left to die. The article explores this ambivalence from a gender perspective and asks how sovereign masculinities are produced through emotional performances in the politics of migration control and management. It will be argued that emotions such as fear, disgust, and compassion are performed in the biopolitical security governance of irregular migration by producing a “socially abject” life as its object. This is a life that is to be killed, despised, and saved. Encounters between the irregular migrant and a European border security actor constitute a neo-colonial masculinity. During the moment of the encounter with the other’s life, sovereignty is produced through emotional performances of border security actors. The discussion concludes with illustrations of how racialized bodies and lives are produced as objects of fear, disgust, and compassion through European neo-colonial masculinity. The article speaks to the debates in the literature on masculinities in global politics, emotions and politics, and critical border studies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",emotions; Masculinity; migration; neo-colonialism; sovereignty,NA,"Agamben, G., (2005) State of Exception, 2. , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Ahmed, S., (2014) The Cultural Politics of Emotion, , 2nd ed, Oxon: Routledge; (2016), https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur27/4864/2016/en/, Stranded Hope: Hungary’s Sustained Attack on the Rights of Refugees and Migrants.

100,Schulz P.,57202914328;,The “ethical loneliness” of male sexual violence survivors in Northern Uganda: gendered reflections on silencing,2018,International Feminist Journal of Politics,7,"Institute for Intercultural and International Studies, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany","Schulz, P., Institute for Intercultural and International Studies, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany","In this article, I explore the gendered silencing of conflict-related sexual violence against men and of male survivors’ lived realities in Northern Uganda using the frame of masculinities. Utilizing Stauffer’s conceptual framework of “ethical loneliness,” I elucidate how male survivors’ experiences of sexual violence are characterized by various layers of externally imposed silences by different actors and institutions often over decades. I demonstrate that the harms experienced by survivors in Northern Uganda are characterized by silence, isolation and abandonment, “compounded by the cruelty of wrongs not being heard” and constituted through multiple rounds of neglect. Exemplified through the narrative of a male survivor, I argue that in particular, the externally imposed silencing by institutions designed to listen entrenches further harms. I unpack how these layered silences are gendered and conditioned by socially constructed incompatibilities between masculinities and vulnerabilities, which disallow men to openly speak about their sexual violations and to seek services and support. Working with the concept of “ethical loneliness,” I propose a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of externally imposed and gender-specific silencing with wider utility beyond male sexual violence, applicable to survivors of political and wartime gendered violence more broadly. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Gender; masculinities; sexual violence; silence; Uganda,NA,"Alcoff, L., The Problem of Speaking for Others (1991) Cultural Critique, 20, pp. 5-32; Baines, E., (2017) Buried in the Heart: Women, Complex Victimhood and the War in Northern Uganda, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Baines, E., Rosenoff-Gauvin, L., Motherhood and Social Repair After War and Displacement in Northern Uganda (2014) Journal of Refugee Studies, 27 (1), pp. 282-300; Connell, R.W., (2005) Masculinities, , 2nd Edition, Berkeley: University of California Press; DelZotto, A., Jones, A., (2002), Male-on-Male Sexual Violence Wartime: Human Rights’ Last Taboo?
